## Configuration menu (Color picker changes)

###  Bug fixes
- Fix some bugs that could occur after resizing the minecraft game window with the config menu opened :
  - Buttons and some elements that are not resized
  - Accessibility linked problems when you use the tab key to navigate
  - Narrator issues

### Changes
- Before, changing the color with the slides or with the "use the vanilla color" button always update the configured values even when you use the escape key to close the menu. Now the changes will only be applied by pressing the "Apply and close" button which replace the old "done" button.

### Features
The color picker menu is now a full config menu which allow to change configs which was previously only changed with key binds or commands.
- Add a new button to reset the color values
- Add a new button to change the comparator mode
- Add a new button to change if the hovered item is highlighted too
- Add a new button to toggle the highlighting
