## Configuration menu (Color picker)

###  Bug fixes
- Fix some bugs that could occur after resizing the minecraft game window with the color picker menu opened :
  - Buttons and some elements that are not resized
  - Accessibility linked problems when you use the tab key to navigate
  - Narrator issues 
  - 

### Changes
- Before, changing the color with the slides or with the "use the vanilla color" button always update the configured values even when you use the escape key to close the menu. Now the color will change only by pressing the "done" button which become a real confirmation button.

### Features
- Add a new button to reset the color values
